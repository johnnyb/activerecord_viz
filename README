This is a plugin to generate a GraphViz chart of your ActiveRecord models through a rake task.  

To install the plugin, just do:

script/plugin install http://activerecordviz.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/trunk/activerecordviz

To generate the chart, just do:

rake arviz:argraph:create

and it will generate the file db/argraph.dot which can then be viewed with Graphviz.
Graphviz will generate the graph visualization, and then can export it to a number of 
formats.  Graphviz is available at:
